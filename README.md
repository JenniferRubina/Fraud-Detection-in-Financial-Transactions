# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model i.e. Random Forest, designed to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions. 
The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data and identify potential fraud in real-time. 
Developed using Python, this project aims to provide a robust solution for financial institutions to safeguard against fraudulent transactions.

## Features
* Real-time Fraud Detection: Identifies suspicious transactions as they occur.
* Machine Learning Models: Utilizes Random Forest and other supervised learning techniques.
* Scalable Solution: Designed to handle large volumes of transaction data.
* Python Implementation: Developed using Python and various data science libraries.
